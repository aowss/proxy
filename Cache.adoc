Client ->> Proxy : Request

Proxy ->> Backend : **Backend** Request
Proxy <-- Backend : **Backend** Response

public  <T, S, R> CompletableFuture<R> process( 
    T request, <1> <2>
    Function<T, CompletableFuture<S>> processRequest, <1> <2> <3> <4>
    Function<S, R> processResponse <2> <3>
);
----
<1> The API shoud be asynchronous +
All the methods and functions should return `CompletionStage` or `CompletableFuture`. +
The `processResponse` function doesn't because this is typically a fast process.
<2> Request and Response should be generic +
The overall method should therefore be `<T, R> CompletableFuture<R> process(T request)`.
<3> The Backend Request and Response are different from the Request and Response +
The Request might be an HTTP GET request while the Backend Request might be an HTTP POST request or a database query. +
The Backend Response might be a database result, while the Response might be an HTTP response with specific headers.
<4> The Backend Request is not used anywhere in the rest of the API so there is no need to expose it +
The `processRequest` function should take care of the mapping from Request to Backend Request. +
That functionality will typically be curried into that function.

== Caching Proxy

Proxy ->> Cache : Retrieve Response from Cache

alt Response in Cache

    Proxy -> Proxy: Process **Backend** Response
    Proxy ->> Cache : Store Response in Cache
    Client <-- Proxy : Response

public  <T, K, S, R> CompletableFuture<R> process(  
    T request,
    Function<T, K> extractKey, <1>
    BiFunction<T, Function<T, K>, CompletableFuture<Optional<R>>> retrieveFromCache, <1> <2> <3>
    Function<T, CompletableFuture<S>> processRequest,
    Function<S, R> processResponse,
    BiFunction<S, Function<S, R>, BiConsumer<K, R>> storeInCache <1> <4>
);
----
<1> The Key that is used to store in / retrieve from the Cahce is most likely a `String` but it doesn't have to be
<2> The Response might not be in the Cache +
The `retrieveFromCache` function should return an `Optional`.
<3> The requester might not want a cached Response even if one is available footnote:[the Request could be an HTTP request that contains a `no-cache` directive] +
The `retrieveFromCache` function should take the entire Request as its input, not only the key. +
Since it still needs the Key, it should take the Key or the `extractKey` function as a second input.
<4> The decision to cache the Response might depend on properties from the Backend Response +
The Backend Response should be an input to the `storeInCache` function in the same way the Request should be part of the `retrieveFromCache` function. +
